<h1>My Website for Web Class Assignments</h1>

<img src="img/Photography-512.png" alt="Woman with camera">

<p>This class will hold all of my assignments for my Web Design class. As a photographer and Visual Art Design major, I hope to gain some skills in other aspects of design to become a well-rounded designer. Throughout my journey, I've not only had the opportunity to learn new skills such as drawing, but I've also been able to hone in and fine tune my skills in Photoshop, Illustrator, and take on other apps in Adobe Cloud including InDesign and After Effects. With this class, I hope to one day build my own website for my business.</p>
